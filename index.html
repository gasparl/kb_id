            <p><b>Study Goal:</b>
                <br>The study aims to assess the validity of typing-based authentication. You will be asked to type in
                various texts, and we record the time elapsed between key presses. We examine – based on the typing pattern – whether a person who wrote a text is the same that
                wrote a previous text. In one part of the study, you will be asked to try to fake the way you type.
                In the rest of the study, you will be asked to type as you normally would. At no point will we be able
                to connect the typing data to you individually.</p>
            <p><b>Payment and Rules:</b>
                <br>Completed and valid participation will be rewarded with GBP 1.00 and the task will take between 10-15 minutes. You can stop participating in the study at any time and without giving reasons. In that
                case, all your data will be erased, and you will not receive payment.</p>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>

        <div class="longtext">
            Your task is as follows. You will see a short text in the middle of the screen. Memorize this text and press Enter. The text will then disappear and you have to type it into a text field from memory.
            <br>
            <br>
            Example: (1) The text "the sky is blue" appears. (2) You press Enter. (3) The text "the sky is blue" disappears and a textbox shows up in which you have to type "the sky is blue".
            <br>
            <br>
            Please try to be accurate. Minor typos, e.g. "bleu" or "blu" instead of "blue", are acceptable. However, if your typed text is very different from the original text, a warning screen will be
            displayed (and you may have to wait a few seconds before continuing).
            <br>
            <br>
            Please use lowercase letters only. Copy-pasting is disabled, and you should not try using it.
            <br>
            <br>
            You will now start with two practice trials.
