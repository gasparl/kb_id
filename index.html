            <p><b>Study Goal:</b>
                <br>The study aims to assess the validity of typing pattern based authentication. You will be asked to type in various texts, and your keypress details (the time of pressing down and letting up each key) will be recorded. Using the
                data
                obtained from many participants in this study, we will try to see whether or not we can identify the person who truly wrote a specific text section, based on the typing pattern of the same person in other text sections. In one part
                of
                the study, you will be asked to try to fake the way you type. In the rest of the study, you will be asked to type as you normally would.</p>
            <p><b>Payment and Rules:</b>
                <br>The test takes around 20-25 minutes. (Not counting any voluntary short breaks during testing, which you may take any time.) Completed and valid participation will be rewarded with $3.00 gross. You can stop participating in the
                study (by closing or refreshing the website) at any time, and without giving reasons. In
                that
                case,
                all your data will be erased, and you will not receive payment.</p>
            <p><b>Data:</b>
                <br>The data from the following test will be used and published to be freely available for research purposes. The data will not reveal who you are, you will not be named and your identity will remain strictly confidential.</p>
            <p><b>Website and Contact:</b>
                <br>This web-based experimental program has been thoroughly tested and proven stable many times, but we do not take responsibility for potential unexpected technical issues. Nonetheless, if you experience any problems, you can
                contact
                gaspar.lukacs @ univie.ac.at (Gaspar Lukacs at the University of Vienna).</p>
            <p><b>Consent:</b>
                <br>
                By clicking the "Consent" button below, you confirm that you have read and understood the participation information. You also confirm that you will be concentrating on the tasks and answering questions truthfully and to the best of
                your knowledge.</p>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>

        <div class="longtext">
            Your task is as follows. You will see a short text in the middle of the screen. Memorize this text and press Enter. The text will then disappear and you have to type it into a text field from memory.
            <br>
            <br>
            Example: (1) The text "the sky is blue" appears. (2) You press Enter. (3) The text "the sky is blue" disappears and a textbox shows up in which you have to type "the sky is blue".
            <br>
            <br>
            Please try to be accurate. Minor typos, e.g. "bleu" or "blu" instead of "blue", are acceptable. However, if your typed text is very different from the original text, a warning screen will be
            displayed (and you may have to wait a few seconds before continuing).
            <br>
            <br>
            Please use lowercase letters only. Copy-pasting is disabled, and you should not try using it.
            <br>
            <br>
            You will now start with two practice trials.
