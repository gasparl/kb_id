            <p><b>Study Goal:</b>
                <br>The study aims to assess the validity of typing pattern based authentication. You will be asked to type in various texts, and your keypress details (the time of pressing down and letting up each key) will be recorded. Using the
                data
                obtained from many participants in this study, we will try to see whether or not we can identify the person who truly wrote a specific text section, based on the typing pattern of the same person in other text sections. In one part
                of
                the study, you will be asked to try to fake the way you type. In the rest of the study, you will be asked to type as you normally would.</p>
            <p><b>Payment and Rules:</b>
                <br>The test takes around 20-25 minutes. Completed and valid participation will be rewarded with $3.00 gross. You can stop participating in the study (by closing or refreshing the website) at any time, and without giving reasons. In
                that
                case,
                all your data will be erased, and you will not receive payment.</p>
            <p><b>Data:</b>
                <br>The data from the following test will be used and published to be freely available for research purposes. The data will not reveal who you are, you will not be named and your identity will remain strictly confidential.</p>
            <p><b>Website and Contact:</b>
                <br>This web-based experimental program has been thoroughly tested and proven stable many times, but we do not take responsibility for potential unexpected technical issues. Nonetheless, if you experience any problems, you can
                contact
                gaspar.lukacs @ univie.ac.at (Gaspar Lukacs at the University of Vienna).</p>

                By clicking the "Consent" button below, you confirm that you have read and understood the participation information. You also confirm that you will be concentrating on the tasks and answering questions truthfully and to the best of
                your knowledge.</p>

        <p><b>Gender:</b></p>
        <input type="radio" name="gender" class="dem_form" value="1"> Male
        <input type="radio" name="gender" class="dem_form" value="2"> Female
        <p><b>Age:</b></p>
        <input type="number" value="" min="1" max="120" class="dem_form" id="age">

    <div id="intro" class="defau">
        In the entire following test, on each trial you will see a short text. You will have to memorize this text and press Enter. The text will then disappear, and you have to type it from your memory.
        <br>
        <br>
        Example: (1) The text "the sky is blue" appears. (2) You press enter. (3) The text "the sky is blue" disappears and you have a textbox where you have to type "the sky is blue".
        <br>
        <br>
        Please try to be accurate, but do not worry about small mistakes. Occasional typos, e.g. "bleu" or "blu" instead of "blue", are acceptable. However, if your typed text is very different from the original text, your will get a warning.
        <br>
        <br>
        Please use lowercase letters only. (Hence, do not use <i>Shift</i> or <i>Caps Lock</i>).
        <br>
        <br>
        The following two trials will serve as practice, to get used to the task.
        <br>
        <br>
        <div class="start_button">
            <button type="button" onclick="starttask();">OK</button>

        <br>
        <br>
        <span id='section_text'>
            The remaining test will be the same, but it will consist of four sections. You will receive instructions before each section separately.
            <br>
            <br>
            In this section, <b>please type just as you normally would</b>. This represents a scenario where you simply use the computer in a regular situation (e.g. drafting a document for your legal work or writing casual chat messages) and you
            have nothing important to hide.
            <br>
            <br>
            In this section, <b>please try to fake your way of typing</b>. It is up to you how you do this. This represents a situation where you engage in a serious illegal activity while using your computer (e.g. drafting a plan for a terrorist
            attack or arranging a contract murder via chat messages) and it is important for you to hide your identity, which may be detected based on the way you type.
